## ✨ What is Aurelia?

**Aurelia Protocol** is a capital-efficient DeFi platform that unifies multiple financial primitives into a seamless ecosystem:

- 🔁 **Leveraged Yield Farming** — Multiply exposure to LPs via automated recursive loops
- 🏦 **Decentralized Lending** — Dual-market system for collateralized and isolated markets
- 🧠 **Metavaults** — Autocompounding vaults that allocate across top-tier yield sources
- 🔄 **Cross-Protocol Integrations** — Tap into Pendle, Aave, GMX, and more
- 💡 **Smart Rebalancing** — Adaptive vault logic to optimize based on real-time APY
- 🛡 **Risk Mitigation** — Vault-level stop-losses, audit-backed contracts, oracle-based liquidations
- ⚖️ **Governance-Driven** — Vote, stake, and earn protocol revenue via veAURE

## 📦 Key Modules

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Metavaults** | Diversified, compounding vaults for stablecoins, ETH/BTC, or thematic strategies |
| **Lending Markets** | Isolated sub-markets for LP tokens, bluechips, and yield-bearing assets |
| **Looping Engine** | Automated leverage logic to maximize capital efficiency |
| **Liquidity Routing** | Internal DEX/aggregator integration for optimal swaps |
| **Yield Optimization** | Real-time APY tracking, reallocation, and harvesting |
